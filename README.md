Thank you for taking the time to review my project. This project focuses on simulating an online banking system. It includes key features such as user registration with unique ID and password creation, secure login, cash deposit, cash withdrawal, and several additional functionalities designed to enhance the user experience.

1. User Authentication & Security

   Login/Logout System – Username and password verification.

   PIN-based transaction confirmation – A simple numeric PIN check for transfers or withdrawals.

   Encryption of stored credentials – Even if basic (e.g., Caesar cipher), to demonstrate security concepts.

2. Account Management

   Create Account – Register new users with account number, name, contact details, initial deposit.

    View Account Details – Show account number, holder’s name, balance, and last transaction.

    Update Details – Edit contact information or change password.

3. Transactions

    Deposit Money – Increase balance and log transaction history.

    Withdraw Money – Deduct from balance if funds are sufficient.
 
    Fund Transfer – Send money between accounts (update both balances).

4. Transaction History

    Store recent transactions in a file or structure.

    Display deposit/withdrawal/transfer details with timestamps.

5. File Handling

    Store user data and transaction history in files (.txt or .dat).

    Allow persistence so data remains after program restarts.

6. Balance Enquiry

    Show current account balance.

    Optionally include daily withdrawal limits.

7. Admin Features

   View all accounts.

   Delete or freeze an account.

   Reset forgotten passwords.

8. Extra (Optional Advanced Features)

   Interest Calculation – Automatically calculate and add interest after a set period.

   Loan Management – Apply for loans, approve/reject by admin.

   Mini Statements – Display only the last N transactions.

   Multi-user Session Simulation – Mimic multiple customers accessing the system.
